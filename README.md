# Workshops.KernelAI

This repository contains sample code and exercises related to [Matt Eland's](https://www.matteland.dev) workshop on Semantic Kernel, Kernel Memory, Microsoft.Extensions.AI, and Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation.

## Configuration

This workshop uses .NET 8 and assumes you are working with Visual Studio 2022 or later, JetBrains Rider, VS Code, or the .NET CLI.

Because this is an AI workshop, you will need access to a chat model with tool support and an embedding model.

This code is pre-configured to work with either Ollama models running locally or Azure OpenAI.
